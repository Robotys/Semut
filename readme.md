# SEMUT

Blogging with wordpress is not as seamless as web development with git (commit -> push -> live).

Thus Semut is develop to reflect blogging as web development flow. It should be easier to use for programmers.

It should be easy to modify to, for web development who has touch PHP, even a little. Because the code is all procedural.

Well, except fot he parsedown class.

Themes style is inspired from [qrohlf.com](http://qrohlf.com/posts/learn-to-code-then-learn-cs/)
